# -Stock-Market-Real-Time-Data-Analysis-Using-Kafka
The Stock Market Kafka Real-Time Data Engineering Project aims to build a comprehensive data pipeline for processing and analyzing real-time stock market data using Apache Kafka and various other technologies. The project leverages Python as the primary programming language and utilizes several Amazon Web Services (AWS) components such as S3, Athena, Glue Crawler, Glue Catalog, and EC2.

The key technology at the core of this project is Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform that allows for the collection, storage, and processing of real-time data streams. Kafka will be used to ingest stock market data in real-time, ensuring high throughput and fault-tolerant data delivery.

The project also makes use of AWS services to enhance the data pipeline. S3 (Simple Storage Service) acts as a scalable and durable storage solution for persisting the stock market data ingested by Kafka. Athena, a serverless query service, enables interactive and ad-hoc analysis of the data stored in S3 using standard SQL queries. Glue Crawler and Glue Catalog assist in cataloging and organizing the data, making it easier to discover and analyze.

Furthermore, EC2 instances are employed to support the processing and transformation of the data. Python is the programming language used for implementing the data engineering tasks, allowing for flexible and efficient data manipulation, transformation, and integration.

Overall, this project offers an end-to-end solution for real-time stock market data engineering, enabling the collection, storage, and analysis of data using Apache Kafka, Python, and various AWS services. It provides a foundation for building sophisticated applications and insights related to the stock market based on up-to-date data.
